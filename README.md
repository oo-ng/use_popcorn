This is a Movie Tracker Web Application called usePopcorn, developed using React, allowing users to discover movies, track and analyze their viewing habits. This application integrates the Open Movie Database (OMDB) API, enabling users to search for a vast range of movies and TV shows.

Here's a brief overview of its functionalities:

Search for movies: With an integrated search bar, users can type in the title of any movie or TV show they're interested in. The application queries the OMDB API and fetches the matching results, displaying them for the user.

View movie details: By selecting a movie from the search results, users can view detailed information about that movie, including its IMDB rating, runtime, and other relevant details.

Track watched movies: Users can add movies they have watched to a "Watched" list. This allows users to keep track of all the movies they've watched over time.

Analyze viewing habits: The application provides averages of various statistics about the movies the user has watched, such as the average IMDB rating, the user's average rating, and the average runtime of the movies. This feature can provide interesting insights about the user's viewing habits.

Responsive UI: The application's user interface adapts dynamically based on the user's interactions. For example, different components open or close based on user's actions.

This project serves as a great demonstration of React fundamentals, such as managing state with useState and useEffect hooks, data fetching from an API, error handling, and conditional rendering. It also provides an example of clean code organization, with each component having its defined role, enhancing readability and maintainability.

For anyone looking to understand or demonstrate a basic but comprehensive React application with real-world functionalities, this Movie Tracker Web Application is a great starting point.
